# crypto_signal_tracker
A simple utility for tracking prices of certain cryptocurrencies

The project needs more error-handling with what it already has, but more features would serve it well:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an easy way to add new currencies without editing code (e.g., from stdin)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a database to store time-series data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more advanced signals
