# crypto_signal_tracker
A simple utility for tracking prices of certain cryptocurrencies

The project needs more error-handling with what it already has, but more features would serve it well:  
  an easy way to add new currencies without editing code (e.g., from the terminal)  
  a database to store time-series data  
  more advanced signals
